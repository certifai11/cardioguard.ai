                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Heart Disease Risk Assessment Tool is designed to provide an initial screening for heart disease risk factors. 
                            It uses a machine learning model trained on clinical data to estimate the probability of heart disease based on various patient parameters.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our tool uses a supervised machine learning model that has been trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
                            The model analyzes 13 clinical parameters to estimate the probability of coronary heart disease.
                        </p>
